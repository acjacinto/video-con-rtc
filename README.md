# Simple Peer-to-peer Video Chat Applications
## _A Simple Real Time Video Chat App made with JavaScript for Beginners_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/acjacinto/computerized-voting-system)

Javascript (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion.

Using the WebRTC API I've created a simple peer-to-peer video call application similar to zoom providing real-time communication via application programming interfaces.

## Instruction How to RUN the Program

- Use "Visual Studio Code" and run it as Administrator
- Open the videocon folder
- Go to "Terminal" located at the VScode menu then select "New Terminal"

#### Follow this codes to set up the localhost server and run the js program
- Install dependencies - npm install  
- Start - npm start

#### If Server is Already Active
- goto browser type "localhost:3000"

#### To Test Peer-to-Peer
- just copy "localhost:3000" and paste to another browser tab

## Tech

Simple Peer-to-peer Video Chat Application uses a number of softwares/free softwares to work properly:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) -  A lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop.
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) -  A scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything.
- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) -  A free and open-source project providing web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication via application programming interfaces.
